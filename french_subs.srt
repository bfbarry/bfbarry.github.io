1
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,875
On that heady morning...

2
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:38,708
where from my privileged position...

3
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:43,166
I could hear the birdsong
preceding the sounds of the city...

4
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,166
I reflected upon the fortune, the audacity...

5
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:52,500
and, dare I say it, 
the ingenuity that had led to my being there...

6
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,958
a place where my imagination, albeit colourfu...

7
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,083
could never have brought me alone.

8
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,000
Six weeks earlier I had been...

9
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,666
a strictly one-woman man...

10
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,916
contentedly enamoured of family and homeland...

11
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:15,000
a man whose gaze was never averted...

12
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,083
by female passers-by...

13
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,291
Sixth floor.

14
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,041
Me too.

15
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:44,416
- The lights are on a time switch.
- You think so?

16
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,541
Sorry. Excuse me.
Please, forgive me.

17
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,500
Pick me up.
I'll leave my car here.

18
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,291
That's right.

19
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,291
Me too, yes.

20
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,083
Do you love me?

21
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,125
Undeniably.

22
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,208
Yes. indisputably.

23
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,666
Marthe, I don't have time for this...

24
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:26,875
Pintard!

25
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:31,250
That's twice this week you've stuck
Le Priouret in the minister's file.

26
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,750
Are you ill?

27
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,958
The minister specifically asked
for another copy.

28
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,916
Really? I'm sorry.
Don't worry, love.

29
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,750
Are you afraid of me?

30
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,208
Bastard!

31
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,500
Information Office Manager

32
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,708
How about dinner?

33
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:51,916
What?

34
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,041
Tonight at the Recamier,
Rue Recamier.

35
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,916
I recognise your voice you know.

36
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,083
At nine o'clock?

37
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,666
Why?

38
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,583
Because.

39
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,458
I can't at nine.

40
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,833
Ten past nine.

41
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,125
Why are you speaking English?

42
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,875
Aren't you...

43
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,958
I'd understood you were British.

44
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,166
Not at all.

45
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:56,166
I'll check.
I'd be surprised though because...

46
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,208
Wait... what time is it?

47
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:01,916
What am I doing?

48
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,291
Why do you do that at passing cars?

49
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,583
So I can see them.

50
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,541
Why are you staring?
How do I look?

51
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,833
Very elegant.

52
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,291
What? I'm off to work
in Rue Saint-Jacques.

53
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,083
These are hurting.

54
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,916
- Here, I haven't got a bag.
- Careful!

55
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:02,291
Off to school with the teachers
at 41 years old.

56
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,166
- When are the exams?
- Silly!

57
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,208
In 23 days' time. 22.

58
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,916
Wearing your little shoes?

59
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,458
I meant to tell you.

60
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:31,083
Tonight, I think I'll give your
bearded classmates a miss.

61
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,208
Where's the cinema programme?

62
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,875
I thought I'd catch a movie.

63
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,166
It's all been organized.

64
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,083
You're going to the 8-o'clock show
with the girls.

65
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,166
They're a bit fed up
so I promised them. ls that OK?

66
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,083
Fantastic!

67
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,250
Mind my earrings!

68
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,416
Good serve! Thirty all.

69
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,666
- Out!
- Out! Thirty-forty.

70
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,625
- Out?
- Just

71
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,291
Get on your bike
and see for yourself.

72
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,166
You're putting me off!

73
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,083
Sorry, darling!

74
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,083
Ready?

75
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,083
Go on!

76
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,083
PARDON MON AFFAIRE

77
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,375
I was wrong-footed.
They talk too much.

78
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,541
Very funny. It's distracting!

79
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,291
I keep my mouth shut.

80
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,541
How's it going otherwise?

81
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,333
How about you?

82
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,791
Awful. Don't ask.

83
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,000
Hey' guys...

84
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,083
Can we have
our ball back, miss?

85
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,541
Thanks a lot.

86
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,041
She missed!

87
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,250
Check out the legs!

88
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,416
There you go!

89
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,500
Like the short and curlies, guys?

90
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,791
Cut it out, it's embarrassing.
I don't like it.

91
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,666
Haven't I seen you around?

92
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:33,541
If they attack, aim for their feet.
Don't lob.

93
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:37,000
- Why not?
- You leave them short.

94
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,250
- Are those Peugeot rackets?
- They're Montana!

95
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,291
They're so irritating.

96
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,625
I think I must have pulled a muscle.

97
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,041
Come on, Simon!

98
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,208
And mind the foot faults.

99
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,958
Are you losing your socks?

100
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,208
Foot faults!

101
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,666
An ace!

102
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,291
Fifteen-love. Go, Mr Bouly!

103
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,291
Well played.

104
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,000
Ready!

105
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,708
What a passing shot!

106
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,333
Well played, Mr Bouly!

107
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,416
It's so easy.
He doesn't even need me.

108
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,625
Got a cigarette, Simon?

109
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,541
- Ready?
- Thirty-love. Keep 'em peeled!

110
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,166
Quick, quick!

111
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,250
Excuse him, miss.

112
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,250
They have no manners.

113
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,000
You're a good player.
Are you ranked?

114
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,916
What was that?

115
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,333
A topspin lob.

116
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,833
You're useless at topspin.
I asked you not to lob!

117
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,666
What do you expect?
My shoulder hurts.

118
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,166
I love playing mixed doubles.

119
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,833
We'll lose.

120
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,083
- How many?
- Forty-love, match point.

121
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,791
Leave it! Go on!

122
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,541
- Sorry.
- You're just a bit off form.

123
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,291
Wait till Sunday.

124
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,291
I didn't know she had a sister.

125
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,750
She turned up
at the factory yesterday

126
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:22,000
and said, "Meet Carmen."
You should have seen her!

127
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,833
Are they really Spanish?

128
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:29,208
I don't know, I didn't ask
for their passports.

129
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,541
I doubt it.
The big one's called Esther.

130
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,083
- Esther doesn't sound very...
- Iberian!

131
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:40,583
- Is she good?
- I'd give the big one 6 out of 10.

132
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,541
Ask me about the other tomorrow.

133
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,083
I'm taking her out tonight.
Simon!

134
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:50,083
Simon!
I bet he's forgotten his towel.

135
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,083
Come on, the shower's yours!

136
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,458
Simon!

137
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,291
I can't, I don't have a towel.

138
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,000
Always the same, guys!

139
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,833
Mr Boulifet? Telephone!

140
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,083
Wait.

141
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,791
Bouly, you're wanted on the phone.

142
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,958
Can't you take the call for me?
Sorry but...

143
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,875
If it's SEITA, say I'll call back.

144
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,083
Problems with corn paper.

145
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,000
- Serious?
- An orchestra conductor died.

146
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,125
- He smoked corn.
- That's not how he died, idiot!

147
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,916
The family attacks but...

148
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,041
What about Marie-Ange?

149
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,125
Hasn't she ever picked up
on any of this?

150
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:39,250
Carmen...
That girl from the chemist's...

151
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,500
- Snow White.
- No, the chemist.

152
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:42,791
Jocelyne.

153
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:47,208
Marie-Ange... the kids, the home,
her radio...

154
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,916
38 years old.
I don't want to stereotype but...

155
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,041
She's a happy woman.

156
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,791
What about her?

157
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:56,958
What?

158
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,666
Don't her ears ever prick up?

159
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,166
Marie-Ange's?

160
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,833
Now hang on...

161
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,041
The guy's stupid!

162
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,083
Marie-Ange...

163
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,958
Staying for lunch, doctor?

164
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,083
Bloody hell!

165
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,250
I don't believe it.

166
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,333
I don't believe it!

167
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,875
What else did she say?

168
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,833
Who? Mrs Philippot?

169
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,208
She'd come to do the ironing
and passed them on the stairs.

170
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:25,041
Marie-Ange, the kids,
the furniture...

171
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,083
Why did you bring your bag?

172
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,208
It'd get stolen.
His car's unlocked.

173
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,583
I don't believe it!

174
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:43,250
I don't believe it, guys.
She's taken everything.

175
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:48,041
This is where the tapestry was.

176
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,583
With the two shepherdesses
and that idiot...

177
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,500
Did you have
a premarital agreement?

178
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:55,750
Oh, come on!

179
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,916
Did she have the right
to take the furniture?

180
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,666
Can I make a call?

181
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,958
There's a note.

182
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,541
- What? Where?
- Over there. Look.

183
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,375
That's a note, isn't it?

184
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,416
It's a note, but...

185
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:22,958
Mouchy?

186
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:28,291
I couldn't call from the club.
I'll explain later.

187
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,083
No Mouchy, I...

188
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,791
What?

189
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,666
He told you what?

190
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,208
Well, that's great!

191
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,041
Doesn't sound like Charles.

192
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,833
No, I can't speak to him now.

193
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:49,458
Who did you say would be well rid
of you when you're in hospital?

194
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,250
Does she say where they went?

195
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,000
Didn't she say why?

196
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,041
Yes.

197
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,000
She found a photo...

198
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,791
The one of me with that old bird.

199
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,083
Naked?

200
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,333
No, in a nightclub.

201
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,000
My kids...

202
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,791
What did he say?

203
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,000
My kids...

204
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,916
You said they were stupid.

205
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,750
He only said that
because he was tired.

206
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,958
He adored his children.

207
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,875
I don't believe it.

208
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,333
Shit, I don't believe it!

209
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,250
I've cut myself. What a pillock!

210
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,750
Maybe the kids are at school.

211
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,250
No, it's the Whitsun holidays.

212
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,291
Marie-Ange...

213
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,416
She'll come back.

214
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,625
Don't you believe it.
They never come back.

215
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,708
A woman leaves you
after 15 years of marriage.

216
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,625
Before you know it
you're a stranger to her.

217
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,791
It depends.

218
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:44,333
Bouly has been overdoing it
for the last few years.

219
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,458
But supposing, for example,

220
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:50,000
a chap has a one-off dinner
with another woman.

221
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,958
Maybe they start an affair,
maybe not.

222
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:59,000
His wife doesn't just take off
with the furniture and kids.

223
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,708
Yes!
They're capable of anything.

224
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,291
- What about Mrs Luberon?
- Same.

225
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,791
Who's that?

226
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
This was while you were in Iran.

227
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:20,666
The wife of the professor.
His boss!

228
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,416
I can only see her nights.

229
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,541
Even then only when
the professor's called out!

230
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:30,000
Depends on the seriousness
of the operation.

231
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,750
If it's appendicitis I don't bother.

232
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:36,208
But let's say it's peritonitis...

233
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,041
Then she calls me.

234
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:44,166
It's a 25-minute round trip
in a car.

235
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,333
So by the time he's carefully
washed his hands,

236
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,333
slipped on the gloves...

237
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,916
"Hi, babe.
He's got two legs to amputate."

238
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,083
"Don't move, I'm on my way!"

239
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,416
Dr Simon Messina
General Practitioner

240
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,250
Will you be in this afternoon?

241
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,500
Yes, I'm consulting.

242
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,708
- Can I drop by?
- What's wrong?

243
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,166
I wanted to ask a favour of you.

244
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,791
But it's... personal.

245
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,541
Do you mind hurrying up?
I have to get the car back by 3.

246
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:48,833
Jean!

247
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,875
- Is the customer here for the Rolls?
- Not yet.

248
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,291
I'll wait...

249
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,500
That afternoon I was back at work
as is only natural

250
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,541
for a man whose destiny
is suddenly shaken.

251
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:26,833
I was perfectly aware that
I was planning for the first time

252
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:30,375
to betray Marthe
and the thought of it appalled me.

253
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,125
The stares from colleagues,

254
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,625
oblivious to the drama
now unfolding,

255
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:39,083
devoted to their stupid work,
nevertheless pierced me.

256
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,250
I interpreted them as disapproval.

257
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,833
Although challenging a society
whose morality I respected,

258
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,416
I must confess that
the young lady in red

259
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,041
had set my conscience ablaze...

260
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,083
Now that's enough, Lucien!
I've had it up to here!

261
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,208
Why won't you answer my letters?

262
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,375
What letters? I didn't get them.

263
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,875
I've never heard of 14 letters
going astray before.

264
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,000
- Lucien!
- I love your breasts.

265
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,875
- I can't live without them.
- My breasts?

266
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:35,958
I saw them in the window
when I gave Fats Waller to Delphine.

267
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,916
- The window?
- Of your room.

268
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,375
I love your breasts.
Especially the left one.

269
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,708
- I'll tell your parents!
- I already did.

270
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,833
I said I was going to marry
a married woman.

271
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,916
You're completely crazy!

272
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,458
What did they say?

273
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,416
The old fools can't accept it.

274
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,500
But we don't need
their permission, my love.

275
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,250
Simon, you're the only man
I can ask.

276
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,333
What are you going
to say back to me?

277
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:15,250
"Can't you sort it out, Deschanel?"

278
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:19,541
"Do you want me to come over?
Deschanel, you're a nuisance."

279
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,000
Who's Deschanel?

280
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:24,000
A chap who works with me
at the Ministry.

281
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:27,708
Come on...
Goodbye, doctor. And thanks.

282
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:36,583
At nine. Don't do anything stupid.

283
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,625
Will you be home?

284
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:43,083
Daniel and I are taking Bouly out.
Without you it seems.

285
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,083
Mr Daoud...

286
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:52,583
Come in, Mr Jouglen.
I'll see you right away.

287
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:00,041
Is it another woman?

288
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:01,833
Are you mad?

289
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,916
Political?

290
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:06,000
Goodbye, dear boy.

291
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:11,916
Did you get the results?

292
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:16,375
Thanks.

293
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:19,333
Didn't the lab call you about them?

294
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,291
No.

295
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:24,208
That's not right.

296
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,291
No, it isn't right.

297
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,250
Well?

298
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:33,250
Last time I came, you frightened me.

299
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,625
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

300
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,875
So why did you go...

301
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:48,250
Call the lab and make sure
they haven't made a mistake

302
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:52,541
with Mr Jouglen's triglyceride
and cholesterol levels.

303
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,875
Because if they're correct...

304
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:03,916
I don't know what's wrong with me.
It really throbs.

305
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,791
Maybe I've pulled a muscle.

306
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,250
It's hellish!

307
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:15,833
Barney Bigard on the clarinet,
Cozy Cole on drums.

308
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,958
Not Cozy Cole.
Gene Krupa on drums.

309
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,416
Bet you anything you like.
That's Cozy Cole's sound.

310
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,666
Recorded April 20, 1950.

311
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,833
Gene Krupa left Benny Goodman
in '39...

312
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,458
You're so annoying
with your clarinets!

313
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:33,416
Lucien, get off my bed.
I've got work to do.

314
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,708
In bed? No wonder you're crap.

315
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:38,666
Yeah, right. Now get out.

316
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,208
Got a cigarette, Lucien?

317
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:45,083
Stop pretending you smoke.
You do it wrong.

318
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,291
She can't exhale through her nose.

319
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:50,750
I've given up smoking.
It stops you getting a tan.

320
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:53,083
What the hell do you care?

321
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,916
I'm taking care of my body.

322
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,666
- Haven't you got your keys?
- Yes but...

323
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,125
Didn't they come about the lift?

324
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:04,500
I always take the stairs.
ls it broken?

325
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:06,458
It doesn't stop at our floor.

326
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:09,833
You have to go to the top
then walk down.

327
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,541
Hello, Lucien.

328
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,458
Delphine tells me you've
been accepted.That's great!

329
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:18,916
- How old are you?
- 17.

330
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:21,958
I'm really motivated this year.

331
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:24,916
What time are we going?

332
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,916
- Where?
- To the movies.

333
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,666
We'll have to cancel, love.

334
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:33,166
I've been lumbered with this.
I have to go out again.

335
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,791
Naturally!

336
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,083
And don't make that face.

337
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,458
I'm in a bad mood as it is!

338
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:43,333
I wanted to talk to you about...

339
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,708
Hello, everyone.

340
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:49,125
A contract isn't just
a professional commitment.

341
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:52,208
Today, I wanted to discuss a case...

342
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:58,083
Hi, old fella.

343
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:00,250
Fetch me a beer, would you?

344
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:03,083
Can it wait till I've put
my stuff down?

345
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,000
Thanks awfully.

346
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:15,416
Well!

347
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:18,458
Going through my pockets now?

348
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,875
I need 1,000 francs for Catulle.

349
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,083
- With the hair?
- That's him.

350
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,916
I think they need more drinks.

351
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:34,083
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, nothing.

352
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:36,416
Nothing.

353
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:40,125
I was just leaving. With Deschanel.

354
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:43,208
Who should I meet in the lift?
Old beady-eyes.

355
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:46,208
"Hello, Minister."
"Hello, Dorsay."

356
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:50,166
"Going home? Good.
Go through this with a toothcomb."

357
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,666
The way he talks!
Treats me like his lackey!

358
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:56,833
The one night you were taking
the girls out.

359
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,833
Tell me about it!
I feel awful.

360
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,083
Will it take long?

361
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,083
Oh no! I have to read 600 pages
and pick out 12.

362
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,625
I've delegated half of them
to Deschanel.

363
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:12,666
Let's just hope
Deschanel can manage.

364
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:18,083
- Fancy a drink?
- Yes. Maybe.

365
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,041
No, right now I'm...

366
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:26,083
worn out.

367
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:29,916
- Who fancies a movie?
- No-one! Let's go to my place.

368
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,416
I can't...

369
00:28:08,916 --> 00:28:10,791
Why are you shaving?

370
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,291
Why am I shaving?

371
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,458
What's all this?

372
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:28,500
What? Well, it's Bouly's kid.

373
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,500
I know that
but what's he doing here?

374
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:37,208
Haven't you... heard?

375
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:51,291
I was asking you where she is.

376
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:53,541
I understood. But I don't know.

377
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,541
I swear.

378
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:10,083
- Gentlemen...
- What'll you have, Andre?

379
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,708
A pastis.

380
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,083
Two pastis.

381
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:15,208
Rene!

382
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,208
I feel good.

383
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:27,750
I'll be right back...

384
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,083
Want one? What was that?

385
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,666
Nothing, sir. I'll get you a Ricard.

386
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:37,791
- Rene!
- He'll be right back.

387
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:41,000
Rene!

388
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:51,375
- Enjoying it?
- Oh, yes!

389
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:58,041
What a prick!

390
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:59,416
Where's Rene?

391
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,416
Not this way!

392
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:03,916
Not this way!

393
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,208
Please, follow me.

394
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:08,791
There's a table in the corner.

395
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:10,416
I want Rene.

396
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,000
What's this? Rene!

397
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:17,000
Where's Rene?

398
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,500
He's so stupid.

399
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,625
Maybe but it's funny!

400
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:32,083
I'd better get back.

401
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:38,250
Well, Andre?

402
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,500
There you are.
Why did you leave me?

403
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:43,458
Don't ever leave me.

404
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:45,708
Come on, let's go.

405
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:51,166
You'll have to excuse him, he's...

406
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,166
You know, you're crazy!

407
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:11,833
It was better last time
at La Coupole.

408
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:17,000
I prefer telephone tricks.
Nobody sees you.

409
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,750
I called her family in Arcachon.
They don't know where she is.

410
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:28,708
- Don't think about it.
- I can't help it.

411
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:33,083
Want me to play the cop?
Just give me a policeman's helmet.

412
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,875
Thanks, it's nice of you but...

413
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:39,166
Come on, let's go to a brothel.

414
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:41,875
It's not as if we know of any.

415
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,458
Bedtime!

416
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:48,083
Mummy will come for you
in the morning.

417
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:51,166
Goodnight, little man.

418
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:54,875
I hear you do lousy smashes
at tennis!

419
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:56,375
What did he say?

420
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:57,791
Nothing.

421
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,916
Best get some sleep. It's late.

422
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:05,166
Apparently,
you always want to smash

423
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:07,750
but you're awful at it.

424
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:09,375
Who told you that?

425
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:13,208
My dad. He can beat you any time.

426
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:16,291
Ridiculous!
Give him a kiss.

427
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:21,083
Creep!

428
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:23,916
Great!

429
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:27,708
She takes off after 13 years
and we get the ugly one!

430
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:32,250
Look, she asked me to have him
for one night. What could I say?

431
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:34,666
- What do we tell Bouly?
- Nothing!

432
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,125
She forbids it. So do I.

433
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:39,791
You too?
Does she need a manager now?

434
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,083
She doesn't need anyone.

435
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,333
Especially not him.

436
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:48,333
The guy's a bastard.

437
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:52,416
It's been going on for ages.
If I were her, I'd...

438
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:54,041
You'd what?

439
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:58,666
I warn you, Etienne...

440
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:03,541
were anything to happen to us,
there'd be no holds barred.

441
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,083
Anyway, let's not...

442
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:10,750
Yes, let's!
Since we've started...

443
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,041
You have to protect me.

444
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:19,458
I may look strong
but you know that deep down I'm...

445
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,250
- Not all the time.
- Why are you telling me this?

446
00:33:25,416 --> 00:33:28,208
- Because you asked.
- Look, Marthe...

447
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:30,583
- Now where is it?
- What?

448
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,833
Are you off your rocker?
Who gave you that?

449
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,833
- Mum. Ages ago.
- When?

450
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,208
When she moved.
She gives her kids everything.

451
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:46,291
What if you'd shot me?

452
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:50,083
I wouldn't have,
since you wouldn't hurt me.

453
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:51,666
You're not Bouly.

454
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:56,791
Guess what he did to Marie-Ange
last Thursday, right in front of me.

455
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:59,291
The secretary calls at ten

456
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,916
to say he's working late
at the office.

457
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,583
He did that?
Do such ruses still work?

458
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:08,958
That's just it, they don't.

459
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,333
What was that bang?

460
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:12,125
Nothing.

461
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,083
You could have knocked.

462
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,958
The door was open.

463
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:20,208
Right, I'll get back to work.

464
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:23,125
Will you go to sleep!

465
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:26,000
Instead of patrolling the hallways!

466
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:27,541
It's too early.

467
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:29,375
What time is it?

468
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:39,625
Yes... Deschanel!

469
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:52,833
What?

470
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:58,291
What's wrong with you?
Calling me at home!

471
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:01,958
I told you... I told you!

472
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:05,000
I said nothing of the sort!

473
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:08,166
No. I don't want to go out!

474
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:12,458
No, Deschanel. I'm not going out!

475
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:15,083
No, Deschanel...

476
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:18,875
Right. Goodbye.
My regards to Maude.

477
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:22,750
That really takes the biscuit!

478
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:35,458
What's the matter now?

479
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,916
This is stupid. Shake hands.

480
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:16,750
You're sure it's a haemorrhage?

481
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:18,916
I'm on my way, sugar.

482
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,708
Where are you going?

483
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:34,000
Never you mind. Won't be long.

484
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,000
It's twenty past one.

485
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:39,125
Who called? Was it Marie-Ange?

486
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:09,333
Esperanza!

487
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:12,125
- Hello, Mrs Esperanza.
- Hello, Mr Deschanel.

488
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:13,333
Hello, Dorsay.

489
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:17,166
Incidentally...

490
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:20,708
Shouldn't that list for Mauritania
be here by now?

491
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:23,708
The photocopier's broken down.
But I've got it.

492
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:26,041
Oh no, I don't have the time.

493
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,625
Thank you, Mr Deschanel.

494
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:33,541
Hey, Esperanza,

495
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,750
what did they say
at your medical last month?

496
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:39,125
Hurry, we're starting
15 minutes early.

497
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:43,375
Why 15 minutes early?
They never tell me anything!

498
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,666
It's like an oven in there.
No air-conditioning.

499
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:18,833
If anyone can explain why,
drop us a line.

500
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:24,041
- What's that?
- The mock-up for the loan campaign.

501
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,916
Who's that?

502
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:30,583
Who?

503
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:36,500
Her.

504
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,750
Ask the minister. He found her.

505
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:41,916
Where?

506
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:45,083
On a horse in Saint-Germain.
He goes every Thursday.

507
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:49,791
And what did old beady-eyes
spot galloping through the mist?

508
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:51,833
Money!

509
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:54,958
She isn't...

510
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,125
No.

511
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:11,125
Next day...

512
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,041
Hello, godmother.

513
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:16,291
It was Thursday.
Braving Marthe's questions,

514
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:20,500
I removed my riding boots from
the bag which had been their home

515
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:24,208
since 1958, the year of De Gaulle's
return to power,

516
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:28,083
although the two events
were entirely unconnected.

517
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:31,958
That summer on lle d'Oleron,

518
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:34,166
having been trained
by enthusiasts,

519
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:37,041
my riding activities
were curtailed

520
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:40,750
by a falling-out between horseflesh
and my good self.

521
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,541
As Marthe was quick to point out.

522
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:50,333
I countered tartly that she had
gone back to college

523
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:52,250
20 years after her last failure.

524
00:40:57,041 --> 00:41:00,583
Then I kissed her, censuring myself
for my fit of anger.

525
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:12,416
Thus attired, I sallied forth
on the arm of my godmother

526
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:15,833
with whom I lunched or dined alone

527
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:18,000
every Thursday of my life.

528
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:20,666
I gave no backward glance

529
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:23,958
but I could feel Marthe's eyes
following me closely.

530
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:26,541
She was still puzzled...

531
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:30,708
As was the horse
that had to contend with me.

532
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,208
I set off at a sedate pace

533
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:45,083
so that my mount
would stay the distance.

534
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:48,083
But its happy-go-lucky nature

535
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,583
soon led me astray.

536
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:53,916
And thus did it dawn on me that,

537
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:55,666
desirable as women are,

538
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:59,750
horses are high
and forests deep...

539
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,958
It's personal.

540
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:08,375
Would you like to make peace?

541
00:42:09,541 --> 00:42:11,666
What do you mean, "Who's that"?

542
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:15,875
Someone who had supper alone.
At the Recamier.

543
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:19,000
Rue Recamier.

544
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,250
Is that you?

545
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,875
It is you. My mother had an attack
at about 8 pm.

546
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:28,666
I spent the night at Ambroise Pare.

547
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:31,375
Obviously you had
no way of knowing.

548
00:42:31,541 --> 00:42:33,875
Much better, thank you.

549
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:36,583
She's up and about.

550
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:39,458
Do you know the Ascot?

551
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:43,000
An American bar
on the Champs-Elysees.

552
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,416
Six o'clock.

553
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:50,791
You will?

554
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:56,000
Pavillon du Regent?

555
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:01,458
I'd like to book a table for two
for this evening.

556
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:05,083
Nine o'clock.

557
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:10,791
Blomet.

558
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:13,333
Mr Blomet.

559
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:19,000
I hear you also have some...

560
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:21,250
small bungalows.

561
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:23,916
Now where did I read that?

562
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:27,916
The girls are out, Lucien.
What do you want?

563
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,333
Don't come in, there's no point.

564
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,625
And what's with the skis?

565
00:43:33,791 --> 00:43:37,250
I'm selling them to a friend.
We'll need the money.

566
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:39,708
I told you not to come in!

567
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:42,208
Have you had a smallpox jab?

568
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:45,916
Why do you ask?
Just leave me alone!

569
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:48,500
If we go to Mexico
with Friends of the Louvre

570
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:52,000
as I said in my letter,
you'll need a jab.

571
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:56,458
I'm not going to Mexico
with you, Lucien!

572
00:43:57,041 --> 00:43:59,916
Otherwise it's southern Morocco.

573
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:01,916
No... No!

574
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:06,125
I'm married with children.

575
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:09,208
To you it may seem stupid
and conventional.

576
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:12,000
- I must say...
- That's just the way it is!

577
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:15,666
You're only 17, I'm 41.
Poor fool!

578
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:18,458
- You know, society...
- Go away!

579
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:21,458
Have you had a smallpox jab?

580
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:24,375
It's you who's small and poxy!

581
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,041
I've been running.
It was ringing as I arrived.

582
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:34,458
No. Go ahead.

583
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:39,041
Really?
At the Ministry or his place?

584
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:42,791
Don't worry about me.
There'll be fifteen of us here

585
00:44:42,958 --> 00:44:45,250
and I don't know how long...
What?

586
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:49,958
You know it wasn't very smart
to call me "small and poxy".

587
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:52,458
You must be unhappy
to resort to that.

588
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:56,000
Why are you giving me
all these details?

589
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:58,708
Because you're explaining
everything:

590
00:44:58,916 --> 00:45:02,083
the phone, the Germans,
the schedule...

591
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:06,416
I'll scream.

592
00:45:06,583 --> 00:45:09,041
So will I.
You'll be more embarrassed.

593
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:11,875
You'd better call Simon though.

594
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:16,041
He's expecting you to dinner.
I told him I wasn't free.

595
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:18,083
I didn't know you were...

596
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:23,250
Yes. I suppose it's for Bouly's kid.

597
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:24,958
She came...

598
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:27,208
How come you're here?

599
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:31,666
You mother's hairdryer was
playing up. It's the fuse.

600
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:55,833
It worked this summer

601
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:58,916
when me and Mouchy
did the Massif Central.

602
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:01,333
I won't be cooking souffles...

603
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,000
Mind your backs!

604
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:06,000
Come on, you scouts.
It's ready.

605
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,958
Don't you have anything
for stoning olives?

606
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:15,541
It's all in the bag: plates, bowls...

607
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,166
camping table...

608
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:20,583
What's that? What time is it?

609
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:22,500
Come and sit down.

610
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:24,708
Help yourself.

611
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:26,791
What was your totem?

612
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:29,791
Don't wind me up.
I was never a scout.

613
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:35,833
Do you want to know
how I stoned the olives?

614
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
There!

615
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:43,208
Artistic, isn't it?

616
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:45,333
You're disgusting.

617
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:48,250
So you made it. How are you?

618
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,083
Just imagine, that idiot went and...

619
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:55,250
Anyway, he didn't turn up.

620
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:57,625
We waited and waited.

621
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:01,250
To employ a rather bold image,
we are but pawns.

622
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:02,583
Have you eaten?

623
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:06,458
I hate anyone going through
my things! You did it again!

624
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:07,916
Yes, I did!

625
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:13,291
My sister advised me
to get a bailiff's report.

626
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:16,083
What does your sister know?

627
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:19,458
She's going to be a lawyer
I'll have you know.

628
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:23,333
It's nothing to do with bailiffs.

629
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:28,000
Surely you don't expect her
to pay you alimony.

630
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:34,208
Sorry but he makes me laugh.

631
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:38,083
Go and have a word with him.

632
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,958
Mouchy, can't you see...

633
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:44,083
Talk to him, I say! Or would
you rather I put the gas on?

634
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:45,541
Then say so now!

635
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:48,875
Hello, Etienne. Don't get up.

636
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:52,041
Hello, my poor Bouly.

637
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:57,625
Simon told me. You're living alone?
I envy you, believe me.

638
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,500
You've had a haircut!

639
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:01,833
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

640
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:04,875
- Still as beautiful as ever.
- Flatterer!

641
00:49:05,166 --> 00:49:07,541
I get a letter. Perfectly innocent.

642
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,458
Nothing improper.

643
00:49:09,666 --> 00:49:12,375
You can read it.
A boy I met at some friends'.

644
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:15,208
It's a free country.
He can write, can't he?

645
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:16,916
Mum!

646
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:18,041
Well, him...

647
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:21,083
He makes a fuss!
By what right?

648
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:25,000
I said, "Until we're married,
keep your comments to yourself."

649
00:49:25,125 --> 00:49:28,375
- Know what he said?
- Why are you telling us this?

650
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:32,083
If I can't even get a warm welcome
at my son's...

651
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:33,666
You want me out too!

652
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:37,458
No, but you just turn up
like a tornado!

653
00:49:37,666 --> 00:49:40,166
Everything was nice and peaceful...

654
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:42,958
So you expect me to write
before visiting?

655
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:46,833
I live next door but I need
an appointment. Like a patient!

656
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,208
Look at these men here.
They're staring at you.

657
00:49:51,416 --> 00:49:53,000
Have you no shame?

658
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:56,875
No shame! Are you talking to
your mother or Mrs Luberon?

659
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:59,083
- Mrs Luberon?
- No shame!

660
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:01,541
What's Mrs Luberon
got to do with it?

661
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,875
I know what you're up to
with Mrs Luberon!

662
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:16,291
Women liked Simon but they had
to like him discretely.

663
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:18,125
For 35 years he'd had

664
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:20,083
this love affair with his mother.

665
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:23,625
She was his sunshine and his bane.

666
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:27,291
The man who lived with her
was called Charles du Tillet.

667
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:31,083
His playful stoicism
commanded our respect.

668
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:36,666
Mouchy liked to claim he was
an "international sports shoe boss".

669
00:50:36,916 --> 00:50:39,458
He looked a lot older than he was.

670
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:41,625
He had his reasons.

671
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:46,708
Consumed by problems which,
with hindsight, were academic,

672
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:51,250
my friends failed to realise that,
despite my missed rendezvous,

673
00:50:51,625 --> 00:50:56,166
I was setting sail for a strange land
populated by just one woman.

674
00:50:56,791 --> 00:51:00,500
In matters equestrian,
my progress stuttered somewhat.

675
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:04,000
Oddly, the animal seemed to
sympathise with my predicament,

676
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:06,958
even keeping lookout
behind the locker room

677
00:51:07,083 --> 00:51:11,708
from where - alas! - we saw no sign
of a woman in red.

678
00:51:14,083 --> 00:51:18,416
At the Ministry, my sporting
development went unnoticed.

679
00:51:19,541 --> 00:51:22,875
Still, Mrs Epseranza's behaviour
towards me

680
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,291
remained inexplicably shady.

681
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:33,041
I was racked by questions
I dared not ask her.

682
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:36,583
The advantage their intuition
affords women over men

683
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:40,666
had maybe alerted her to an intrigue
the day I was mad enough

684
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:44,041
to call the young lady in red
in her office.

685
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:49,083
It all suggested that Mrs Esperanza,
a wife and mother,

686
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:52,125
was siding with Marthe
whom she had never met.

687
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:56,916
Whatever the reason,
after much thought,

688
00:51:57,083 --> 00:52:00,125
I opted to ignore her,
despite the provocation.

689
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:05,500
I did suffer, however,
a short period of depression...

690
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:13,291
Come on! Forwards! Hey!

691
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:15,083
Forwards! Come on!

692
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:26,333
However futile my search,
I was as patient as ever.

693
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:29,666
But it was taking its toll
physically.

694
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:32,708
Especially as I had to keep up tennis

695
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:36,083
which Marthe knew
I was so keen on.

696
00:52:39,166 --> 00:52:42,500
Nevertheless, I likened
my predicament to happiness

697
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:45,416
when compared
to the misfortune of a friend

698
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:48,000
who always put on
a brave face for us

699
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:49,666
despite his anxiety.

700
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:52,458
Marie-Ange had vanished.

701
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:54,916
Bouly was camping out at home

702
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:57,750
with the equipment
lent to him by Simon.

703
00:52:58,083 --> 00:53:02,000
As for myself, just as hope
was slipping away,

704
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:04,541
my life became a fairytale...

705
00:53:47,416 --> 00:53:49,833
Whoa, Morning Glory!

706
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:09,875
He's exquisite. I know horses.

707
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:14,125
I'd seen him many times
in his stall and he...

708
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:18,083
He's... Whoa! He's...

709
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,791
He's superb.

710
00:54:19,958 --> 00:54:22,000
Yes, she is beautiful.

711
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,750
We've met before.

712
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:43,791
Let me see...

713
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:46,708
The Ministry
when I signed my contract.

714
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:48,333
Are you sure?

715
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:50,291
Do you ride often?

716
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:52,708
Every day for years now.
And you?

717
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:55,291
No, only for the last 4 or 5 years.

718
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:58,083
Then you must have started as a kid.

719
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:07,916
About the other night.
It was cruel, but well played.

720
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:10,375
The other night?

721
00:55:10,583 --> 00:55:11,916
All right...

722
00:55:13,291 --> 00:55:14,708
Oh, my whip!

723
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:19,875
Apologise, Morning Glory.

724
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:22,375
When a horse is stupid...

725
00:55:42,916 --> 00:55:44,916
Careful, Morning Glory!

726
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:48,083
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

727
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:55,750
Now keep still.

728
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:05,375
You forgot that!

729
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:08,416
Sorry?

730
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,291
Excuse me.

731
00:56:46,958 --> 00:56:48,666
- Well then?
- About time!

732
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:50,666
Hey, don't rush!

733
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:53,416
- Sorry. I had a puncture.
- Again?

734
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:55,416
Your phone was engaged.

735
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:57,500
Change your tune or your tires.

736
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:01,208
- Did a bird bite your knees?
- No. Don't you believe me?

737
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:02,916
- No.
- Who plays with who?

738
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:04,416
This is the decider.

739
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:06,958
Simon is serving. Come on!

740
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:09,625
Just a minute!
Let him warm up.

741
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:11,416
He'll warm up as he plays.

742
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:13,958
Give us a break, will you?

743
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:16,708
Come on, serve!

744
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:19,541
I've located the kids.

745
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:22,083
What?
And you just say it...

746
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,333
I could hardly sing it.

747
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,666
- Where?
- With their uncle in Dunkirk.

748
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:30,125
We're not even allowed to warm up.

749
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:33,166
- And Marie-Ange?
- Still underground.

750
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,041
Ready?

751
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:39,458
If she comes back,
do I thrash her?

752
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:42,750
I think that's up to you to...

753
00:57:43,041 --> 00:57:45,625
Simon!
Don't let me interrupt you.

754
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:48,041
Carry on playing, boys.

755
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:51,291
Play, Bouly.
I just want a word with Simon.

756
00:57:51,625 --> 00:57:53,083
Simon, come here.

757
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:56,250
- What's with all the fur coats?
- I'm leaving.

758
00:57:56,541 --> 00:57:59,541
Do you know what he said?
And he woke me, too.

759
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,750
Guess! No hints.

760
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:04,291
I don't know.
Don't tell me this here!

761
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,083
Where then?
This morning, that madwoman

762
00:58:07,291 --> 00:58:09,916
stopped me going into your office.

763
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:11,083
Mrs Paquet?

764
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:13,291
But I was with Mr Simoni!

765
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:17,333
You lock yourself up with him
when your mum's suicidal?

766
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,875
- Mum!
- There's nothing wrong with him.

767
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:25,250
Nothing wrong?
Shall I show you his X-rays?

768
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:28,041
Nothing at all. Ask Mrs Paquet!

769
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:31,041
But he pays you,
so he can just stroll in.

770
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:34,750
Do I have to pay money to see you?
How much?

771
00:58:34,916 --> 00:58:37,708
Stop it! Stop it!

772
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:41,666
Simon, don't use that tone of voice.
I'm still your mother!

773
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:44,166
I can slap you
in front of your friends!

774
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:48,250
What have I done to deserve this?
Mum, must you?

775
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,916
Goodbye, Etienne.
Goodbye or farewell!

776
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:53,666
Farewell, Bouly.
I've no time for your news.

777
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:55,541
But where is she going?

778
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:58,041
Don't worry,
I'm leaving no address.

779
00:58:58,166 --> 00:58:59,625
You'll save on stamps!

780
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:01,916
Stop it... Stop it!

781
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:10,291
Goodbye.

782
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:12,708
See you tomorrow, Pintard.

783
00:59:13,541 --> 00:59:15,208
Goodbye, Delpech.

784
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:39,375
Dorsay! Just the man I...

785
00:59:58,916 --> 01:00:01,416
I came to return your earring.

786
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:03,208
My What?

787
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:06,708
I picked it up when your horse
had convulsions.

788
01:00:09,875 --> 01:00:11,333
Yes. But...

789
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:16,083
It isn't mine.
I can't imagine where... No.

790
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,166
What else?

791
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:19,625
Nothing.

792
01:00:20,958 --> 01:00:22,083
Dinner?

793
01:00:22,541 --> 01:00:23,708
- No.
- Tomorrow.

794
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:26,000
I know a Chinese restaurant.

795
01:00:26,166 --> 01:00:27,666
Lunch?

796
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,875
I'm not free for lunch tomorrow.
Nor dinner.

797
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:33,916
How about tea-time?

798
01:00:34,791 --> 01:00:36,000
You're drenched.

799
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:37,958
And your tone is a bit dry.

800
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:41,166
Why?

801
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:45,375
I'm flustered.

802
01:00:46,416 --> 01:00:47,541
I'm sorry.

803
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:50,666
You were taken in, there!

804
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,666
- Well... I'm late.
- No!

805
01:00:55,875 --> 01:00:57,083
Absolutely not!

806
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:00,500
- That's just not possible!
- What's not possible?

807
01:01:00,708 --> 01:01:03,083
I was about to say something.

808
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:04,958
Your name, perchance?

809
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:07,625
Etienne Dorsay.

810
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:10,708
How old are you? 40?

811
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:12,250
40-odd.

812
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:14,916
Tomorrow, 4.30 at La Rhumerie.

813
01:01:15,083 --> 01:01:18,125
- Martinique?
- Yes. Will you be there?

814
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:22,708
I should think so!

815
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:40,083
The lift still hasn't been repaired.

816
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,833
Hi, kids.

817
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,833
Hi, old fella.

818
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:47,916
- Fall in some water?
- Water fell on me.

819
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:50,166
Have you seen the weather?

820
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:53,250
- What about your mac?
- My mac...

821
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:55,291
My mac...

822
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,166
It was at Bouly's.

823
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:05,666
And today... I lost an earring.

824
01:02:05,833 --> 01:02:06,875
What?

825
01:02:14,791 --> 01:02:15,958
Oh no...

826
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,750
Horses are certainly sweeter
than dogs.

827
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:22,125
Dogs are more...

828
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,500
Horses are colder. But wait.

829
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:27,875
By cold, don't think I mean...

830
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:30,083
No.

831
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:33,000
You'll say it's a cliche
but with horses,

832
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:36,708
when we climb onto their backs,
do we humans

833
01:02:36,916 --> 01:02:39,333
ask their opinion?

834
01:02:39,541 --> 01:02:40,416
No.

835
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:46,416
Charlotte, maybe it's because
I never married or maybe it's...

836
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:49,000
the need to have children

837
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:50,416
but...

838
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:55,166
if it weren't for my animal friends,
some evenings...

839
01:02:56,875 --> 01:02:59,041
I hate such displays of emotion!

840
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:00,916
I'm not about to...

841
01:03:01,208 --> 01:03:03,708
Where did you get that suit?

842
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:09,041
That's just what you needed.

843
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:12,166
Because to be honest...

844
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:15,208
that photo of you
on the Ministry steps,

845
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,958
the one at your place,
it's so lugubrious!

846
01:03:18,125 --> 01:03:20,416
- How many pants?
- One.

847
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:23,083
No, two.
You work sitting down.

848
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:26,458
Michel, one with turn-ups,
one without.

849
01:03:26,666 --> 01:03:28,916
And no pockets.

850
01:03:30,583 --> 01:03:32,458
With a half-belt?

851
01:03:32,666 --> 01:03:35,458
Now then...
how about a half-belt?

852
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:38,708
To be honest, I don't know.

853
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:43,083
Did she just came out with it,
"You're a lousy dresser"?

854
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:46,875
No, she isn't like that.
You know Marthe.

855
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:49,458
She looks at you, silently.

856
01:03:49,666 --> 01:03:53,416
You say,
"What's the matter with me?"

857
01:03:54,541 --> 01:03:58,833
That's when she says,
"How long have you had that suit?"

858
01:03:59,958 --> 01:04:01,083
Hyenas.

859
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:04,333
They're all hyenas!

860
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:09,875
With all those kids around
I don't want to lag behind.

861
01:04:10,875 --> 01:04:13,791
- Hairspray, or soft?
- No hairspray!

862
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:16,000
Soft. Totally soft.

863
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:18,416
You can look at yourself now.

864
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,666
- Crikey!
- What?

865
01:04:24,791 --> 01:04:26,208
Errol Flynn...

866
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:36,125
Hello, godmother.

867
01:04:36,875 --> 01:04:39,166
Hello, girls.

868
01:04:45,083 --> 01:04:46,833
Good evening, Marthe.

869
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:04,291
Hello, everyone.

870
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:06,375
Sorry.

871
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,875
I'm late.

872
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:14,500
I was with... what's his name again?

873
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:48,958
Pavillon du Regent? Hello.

874
01:05:51,125 --> 01:05:53,250
It's Mr Chabert.

875
01:05:55,666 --> 01:05:56,750
Chabert.

876
01:06:16,833 --> 01:06:18,750
Hold the line, I'll see.

877
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,083
Mr Dorsay.

878
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:40,375
Yes, if you like, miss.

879
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:42,333
Miss Charlotte what?

880
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,083
Sorry...

881
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:45,500
It's for me!

882
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:52,583
Charlotte? It's Etienne.
Aren't you coming?

883
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:55,625
- I'm in London.
- London? Why?

884
01:06:55,833 --> 01:06:59,125
Working.
I tried to call but it was engaged.

885
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:02,583
The minister ofjustice
kept me talking for an hour.

886
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:04,083
Come over here.

887
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,250
Where?

888
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:10,125
The last plane arrives at 10 pm.
I'll wait for you at the airport.

889
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:13,333
In London?

890
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:15,791
But...

891
01:07:16,458 --> 01:07:20,291
We'll spend the evening here
and return tomorrow at ten.

892
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:25,125
Tomorrow morning?

893
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:16,541
Aren't they here yet?

894
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:19,000
- What's that for?
- A party!

895
01:08:19,166 --> 01:08:21,083
- For what?
- For fun.

896
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:25,416
I'm tired so I thought
we'd have a knees-up at home.

897
01:08:25,666 --> 01:08:26,708
It'll be great!

898
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:29,166
I'm sure it will be wonderful.

899
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,833
Look what dad gave me.

900
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:34,458
An orchid.

901
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:58,416
What do you want? Whiskey?

902
01:08:58,708 --> 01:08:59,958
Why not?

903
01:09:02,208 --> 01:09:04,833
And take the phone off the hook.

904
01:09:06,583 --> 01:09:08,750
You don't want to make love now...

905
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,250
I said take the phone off the hook.

906
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,416
- Who's that?
- No idea.

907
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:20,291
Are you 90mg?

908
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:33,166
A telegram.

909
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:35,375
Telegram? For whom?

910
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:36,875
For you.

911
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:38,500
Open it.

912
01:09:41,458 --> 01:09:43,708
- It's the Ministry.
- You're joking!

913
01:09:43,875 --> 01:09:46,500
Really. Who's Martin-Guyot?

914
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:49,500
That guy who's... You know...

915
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:52,333
The bloke who's head of...

916
01:09:52,791 --> 01:09:55,500
- You know, the department.
- He's senior to you?

917
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:59,208
Not for long but he is
for the time being.

918
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:02,416
Read it out then.

919
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:07,166
"Your presence vital this evening
at Brussels symposium.

920
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,125
"Stop. Return midday tomorrow.

921
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:12,375
"Martin-Guyot."

922
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:19,791
No.

923
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,875
Not this time. No, no, no!

924
01:10:25,416 --> 01:10:26,750
I will not go!

925
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:29,041
- I'm not...
- Etienne!

926
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:32,583
I'm not some puppet!
This is the camel that broke the...

927
01:10:33,083 --> 01:10:36,208
- I won't be held hostage!
- What are you going to do?

928
01:10:36,416 --> 01:10:38,083
Nothing. I don't know.

929
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:41,125
Call the minister.
I have his private number.

930
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:45,791
Balzac 14-39. Tell him to go
to Brussels with his lackeys.

931
01:10:45,958 --> 01:10:48,875
I'm staying right here.

932
01:10:49,083 --> 01:10:51,958
With my wife and children!

933
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:57,875
Look, Etienne, you'd better go.
Be grown-up about it.

934
01:10:58,125 --> 01:10:59,125
No!

935
01:11:00,958 --> 01:11:03,083
Hey, wait for me!

936
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:08,583
We shall be arriving in London
in 45 minutes...

937
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:13,791
Oh, shit!

938
01:11:14,208 --> 01:11:15,208
Marie-Ange!

939
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,041
What did she say, Mrs Philippot?

940
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:31,333
Did she go up to the flat?

941
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,750
- No.
- What did she want?

942
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:37,208
- Her mail.
- There was none.

943
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:38,416
No.

944
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:43,375
"Driving school"?

945
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,750
There's some guy there.

946
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:07,041
- A guy?
- Yeah, a guy.

947
01:12:07,166 --> 01:12:10,333
When I rang, a guy answered
the door with a...

948
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,666
A blue T-shirt.
You know, a stripy one.

949
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:16,541
I don't give a shit.
Did you see Marie-Ange?

950
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:17,708
No.

951
01:12:18,041 --> 01:12:19,125
What did you say?

952
01:12:19,791 --> 01:12:22,416
Nothing. When I saw the guy...

953
01:12:22,583 --> 01:12:25,458
I just said I'd got the wrong buzzer.

954
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:33,666
I'll drag her out
by the scruff of the neck!

955
01:12:33,833 --> 01:12:35,666
Watch yourself.

956
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:38,541
He's unpleasant.

957
01:12:39,708 --> 01:12:42,125
Bouly's a joker, asking us to...

958
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:45,208
Let him come and get her.
It's not ourjob.

959
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:49,666
She's not our wife...

960
01:12:58,583 --> 01:12:59,875
Ladies and gentlemen,

961
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:02,458
we are beginning our descent
towards London.

962
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:04,375
Please fasten your seat belts

963
01:13:05,041 --> 01:13:07,708
and extinguish your cigarettes.
Thank you.

964
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:21,208
Ladies and gentlemen.

965
01:13:21,416 --> 01:13:25,083
Due to adverse weather conditions

966
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:27,708
we are unable to land in London.

967
01:13:27,916 --> 01:13:30,250
We have been diverted to Brussels.

968
01:13:30,416 --> 01:13:34,875
Further information will be
available in the airport terminal...

969
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:42,041
I put the hood up.
I felt a few drops.

970
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:43,666
What happened to you?

971
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:47,250
The guy's a contender
for Wanker of the Year.

972
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:52,291
It's funny.
Blokes like him just wind me up.

973
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:55,333
Bang, I'm off!
Pass me a tissue.

974
01:13:55,666 --> 01:13:57,916
- Shall I treat you?
- Leave it out!

975
01:13:58,166 --> 01:13:59,833
Just a scratch.

976
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:02,333
Wanker!

977
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:05,625
And did you see Marie-Ange?

978
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:09,791
Vaguely.
She's really hit the jackpot.

979
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:12,166
Taking 3 kids from their dad for...

980
01:14:12,541 --> 01:14:13,666
Hyenas!

981
01:14:14,208 --> 01:14:16,333
What did you say to her?

982
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:20,958
Nothing. I was having a spat
with that dwarf.

983
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:22,166
What dwarf?

984
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:23,541
The guy!

985
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:36,375
What do we tell Bouly?

986
01:14:37,125 --> 01:14:39,833
I don't know.
A bit of tact is called for.

987
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,958
We could write him a letter.

988
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:45,958
No, no...
We'll tell him that...

989
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:50,083
...there was a driving school
because we can't...

990
01:14:50,416 --> 01:14:55,000
As for Marie-Ange... we'll say
the bird had... And presto!

991
01:14:55,333 --> 01:14:58,916
We'll think of a nice way to put it.

992
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:02,708
- Without mentioning the dwarf.
- Exactly.

993
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:07,166
Welcome to Brussels.

994
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:09,875
Passengers traveling to London

995
01:15:10,041 --> 01:15:14,000
are invited to present themselves
at the restaurant

996
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:16,875
where refreshments will be served.

997
01:15:17,041 --> 01:15:21,041
Further information will be given
in due course...

998
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,833
Yes... why are you calling me?

999
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:45,833
I'm delighted...
I know you're in Brussels...

1000
01:15:51,166 --> 01:15:52,708
Not at all but...

1001
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:59,041
I wasn't really worried.
Brussels isn't...

1002
01:16:01,333 --> 01:16:03,958
Oh, you're so sensitive!

1003
01:16:04,541 --> 01:16:07,625
No, I was fast asleep.
I took a pill...

1004
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:12,583
No. It's your turn.

1005
01:16:13,291 --> 01:16:16,458
Last time,
I was the one who hung up.

1006
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:19,541
I love you.

1007
01:16:19,916 --> 01:16:21,208
One, two, three...

1008
01:16:48,333 --> 01:16:50,375
I know he's away.

1009
01:16:51,833 --> 01:16:52,958
Mum!

1010
01:16:55,708 --> 01:16:59,750
Switch the light off and go
to sleep! That's enough!

1011
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:10,708
You're not going to ring all night.

1012
01:17:10,875 --> 01:17:11,916
I am.

1013
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:13,166
What do you want?

1014
01:17:13,375 --> 01:17:15,166
It's now or never, my love.

1015
01:17:15,958 --> 01:17:17,458
To do what?

1016
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:23,125
Go away!

1017
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:25,208
Leave me alone.

1018
01:17:25,541 --> 01:17:27,083
Leave me alone!

1019
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:30,875
This'll be disappointing
but I have to be frank.

1020
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:34,500
I'm not as tenacious as Moreau
in A Sentimental Education.

1021
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,916
- Really?
- I have to be tough.

1022
01:17:37,416 --> 01:17:41,000
Very tough. I know it's hard
to be dumped when you're 40

1023
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:43,375
but Lucien Raki is out of your life.

1024
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:46,708
It's for the best.

1025
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:50,958
Are you for banning HGVs
from the banks of the Seine?

1026
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:54,208
Why do you ask?

1027
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:57,916
I've got a job
with a polling organization.

1028
01:17:58,083 --> 01:18:00,333
So since I'm here... are you for?

1029
01:18:00,583 --> 01:18:03,375
Well, I don't know...
Against.

1030
01:18:05,333 --> 01:18:06,541
Goodbye, madam.

1031
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:11,250
Anyway, you gave me a thrill.

1032
01:18:13,791 --> 01:18:17,083
At that moment,
had I sifted through my past,

1033
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:21,333
I'd have had to admit there had been
more pleasant nights.

1034
01:18:22,166 --> 01:18:26,666
Yet in this foreign land
where chance had plunged me,

1035
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:31,500
I felt the mad wind of adventure
on the back of my neck!

1036
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:34,125
A woman awaited me in London,

1037
01:18:34,291 --> 01:18:38,750
another in Paris, while I was
stranded in sleepy Brussels.

1038
01:18:39,666 --> 01:18:42,166
Next day,
Charlotte made light of the fog,

1039
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:44,458
and winged her way back to Paris.

1040
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:47,541
There followed a succession
of thrills.

1041
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:51,083
Every day between 4.55 pm
when I left the office

1042
01:18:51,208 --> 01:18:54,791
and 5.50 or 5.52 pm
when Marthe came home

1043
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,916
- with or without her classmates -

1044
01:18:58,083 --> 01:19:01,375
it's fair to say that in the hour
we had together

1045
01:19:01,541 --> 01:19:04,083
Charlotte and I
lived life to the full,

1046
01:19:04,208 --> 01:19:07,750
alternating exhilarating excursions
with hilarious meetings.

1047
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:12,500
Charlotte and I cultivated
the mystery of Charlotte.

1048
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:17,833
She said little about herself.
I dared not violate her silences.

1049
01:19:19,541 --> 01:19:23,250
Better still, so that she would
never for a moment suspect

1050
01:19:23,416 --> 01:19:25,875
the obscenity of my intentions

1051
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:28,333
I was careful never to suggest

1052
01:19:28,541 --> 01:19:31,375
that we meet after nightfall.

1053
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:34,666
We would part
without leaving an address,

1054
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:37,916
her, breathless with pleasure,

1055
01:19:38,708 --> 01:19:41,458
me, face puffed-up with desire!

1056
01:19:42,541 --> 01:19:47,000
Meanwhile Marthe passed the exams
that had so daunted her.

1057
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:50,416
She failed just one oral
and was ready to re-sit.

1058
01:19:50,583 --> 01:19:53,666
...so hard!
You wouldn't believe it.

1059
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:55,333
I admired her.

1060
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:58,458
As for me, I was promoted,
without exam or intrigue,

1061
01:19:58,666 --> 01:20:01,250
and given Martin-Guyot's job

1062
01:20:01,416 --> 01:20:04,833
when he opted to put
his pension fund to work.

1063
01:20:05,416 --> 01:20:07,791
I was now head of the whole floor

1064
01:20:07,958 --> 01:20:10,875
and my promotion,
rather than exciting jealousy

1065
01:20:11,083 --> 01:20:12,958
as was the custom,

1066
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:15,458
heralded unexpected
friendly overtures

1067
01:20:15,708 --> 01:20:18,166
from the more aggressive souls.

1068
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:24,041
I was far too busy to seek
an explanation for this upturn

1069
01:20:24,208 --> 01:20:27,958
on which, although mystified,
I congratulated myself.

1070
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:32,875
That summer, the lives of others
also took a bewitching turn.

1071
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:35,416
Simon

1072
01:20:35,916 --> 01:20:37,416
married off his mother.

1073
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,083
He was delighted

1074
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:40,916
and we shared his joy.

1075
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:43,083
Charles married reluctantly

1076
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:45,666
but as Mouchy said at the reception,

1077
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:48,833
"lt's the result that matters."

1078
01:20:49,208 --> 01:20:52,125
The wedding party was rambling,

1079
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:54,958
showy and a triumph.

1080
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:08,791
- Whose is this?
- Mine.

1081
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:12,541
You're too careless.

1082
01:21:24,375 --> 01:21:27,250
But the best surprise
of the following week

1083
01:21:27,458 --> 01:21:31,666
was the sudden reappearance
of Bouly's wife and furniture.

1084
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:37,625
The reasons for her return
were vague.

1085
01:21:37,791 --> 01:21:40,833
Simon and Daniel claimed
they had precipitated

1086
01:21:41,041 --> 01:21:44,333
the reunion the evening
I had spent away from Paris.

1087
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:49,416
But their account of the incident
was confused and contradictory.

1088
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,875
As for Bouly,
he thought deep down

1089
01:21:54,041 --> 01:21:57,083
that the charm he exuded
was just too powerful

1090
01:21:57,250 --> 01:22:00,583
for the poor girl to resist.

1091
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:05,208
Sad to report that the very next day
he was to be found

1092
01:22:05,458 --> 01:22:09,500
fishing in the same waters
for which he had been punished.

1093
01:22:10,083 --> 01:22:12,875
I'll call you in the middle
of the night

1094
01:22:13,041 --> 01:22:16,875
and say I'm Mrs Luberon.
You'll come and find them in bed.

1095
01:22:17,041 --> 01:22:20,541
Don't do that.
Anyway, you don't know her name.

1096
01:22:21,041 --> 01:22:23,166
What is her first name?

1097
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:25,416
Come on, tell us!

1098
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:26,666
Hyacinthe.

1099
01:22:31,083 --> 01:22:34,458
We laugh because we're stupid.
Hyacinthe's quite nice.

1100
01:22:34,666 --> 01:22:38,166
- "Hello, Hyacinthe..."
- Hey, guys, who fancies

1101
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:40,333
a game with the ladies?

1102
01:22:40,666 --> 01:22:44,333
Save it for when you're at home,
not with us.

1103
01:22:44,541 --> 01:22:46,083
Don't be ridiculous.

1104
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:50,416
Hello, ladies.
How about a game of draughts?

1105
01:22:50,583 --> 01:22:52,458
Is it any wonder?

1106
01:22:52,708 --> 01:22:54,833
- Is what any wonder?
- Nothing.

1107
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:57,833
- Go on, say it.
- Nothing. That's my glass!

1108
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,125
Check out the pins!

1109
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:03,250
Maybe it's all that
running after guys.

1110
01:23:03,458 --> 01:23:05,208
Coffees please, Francoise.

1111
01:23:05,375 --> 01:23:07,916
No bra, did you notice?

1112
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:09,500
Didn't you see?

1113
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:13,958
- I don't give a damn, stop it!
- Stop what? It's cute.

1114
01:23:15,666 --> 01:23:17,208
Stupid bitch!

1115
01:23:55,166 --> 01:23:56,375
Goal!

1116
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,000
Hey, Daniel...

1117
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:20,833
What about my car?

1118
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:26,666
I'd have had it today
but the guy's in Marseilles.

1119
01:24:27,083 --> 01:24:28,833
Because this one...

1120
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:30,958
has had it!

1121
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,125
The key's in the door.

1122
01:25:15,875 --> 01:25:17,375
Oh, it's you.

1123
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,750
How's it going? It's been awhile...

1124
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,875
Been decorating?

1125
01:25:34,083 --> 01:25:37,250
Yes. Well, I started but...

1126
01:25:44,083 --> 01:25:46,208
You should paint the floor too.

1127
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,666
Then put some varnish on it.

1128
01:25:51,083 --> 01:25:52,833
Fancy a drink?

1129
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:54,541
Come on.

1130
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:57,333
Let's see what I've got...

1131
01:26:03,416 --> 01:26:05,458
Do you like chartreuse?

1132
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:08,458
Well... yes.

1133
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:15,416
I wanted to tell you that my life
isn't as transparent...

1134
01:26:17,208 --> 01:26:19,083
as people...

1135
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:25,208
I've been hiding someone too.

1136
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:30,375
Just feel the dashboard.

1137
01:26:30,541 --> 01:26:33,458
Excuse me, Charlotte.
May I call you Charlotte?

1138
01:26:33,666 --> 01:26:36,041
Touchit
Feels like hide, not wood.

1139
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:39,500
Like a baby's bottom!
Go on, tell me what you think.

1140
01:26:40,083 --> 01:26:41,958
Spare me the sales patter.

1141
01:26:42,833 --> 01:26:46,250
Where should I "depose" you,
as we say in Paris?

1142
01:26:46,416 --> 01:26:49,083
Puy de I'Ermite,
since we're in the area.

1143
01:26:50,083 --> 01:26:52,791
You're going to your godmother's?

1144
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:55,208
Of course. Like every Thursday.

1145
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,083
Have you met?

1146
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:04,750
What did you tell
your poor godmother?

1147
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:07,708
Nothing. It's a surprise.

1148
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:11,875
Well...

1149
01:27:13,916 --> 01:27:15,750
That speaks volumes.

1150
01:27:16,583 --> 01:27:20,000
We never get invited
to dinner at your godmother's.

1151
01:27:20,333 --> 01:27:24,000
Pop up for a drink.
She'll be pleased.

1152
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:28,083
Quick one, then.
I love warm sparkling wine.

1153
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:39,250
You're on a crossing.

1154
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,958
Give me a break,
I'll only be 5 minutes.

1155
01:27:42,125 --> 01:27:45,625
You're on a crossing.
You can't stay there.

1156
01:27:46,791 --> 01:27:48,291
Etienne! Go up.

1157
01:27:48,541 --> 01:27:50,208
I'll park the car...

1158
01:27:55,083 --> 01:27:56,583
Seventh floor.

1159
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:02,583
She teaches piano
at Marguerite Long's.

1160
01:28:02,791 --> 01:28:06,875
She's always lived alone.
Her son's married. Lives in Italy.

1161
01:28:07,708 --> 01:28:09,125
His name's Claude.

1162
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:17,625
You're beautiful.

1163
01:28:18,416 --> 01:28:21,000
You smell nice. What is it?

1164
01:28:21,333 --> 01:28:22,958
Sandalwood.

1165
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:26,291
Is that you, Etienne?

1166
01:28:26,458 --> 01:28:28,833
Are you in the dark, godmother?

1167
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:31,250
Come and meet...

1168
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:49,083
Happy birthday!

1169
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:51,708
Claude!

1170
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:54,291
And Jeanne!

1171
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,833
- Aren't you in San Remo?
- They're visiting.

1172
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,041
Quite a surprise!

1173
01:29:01,166 --> 01:29:02,708
- And Yaya!
- Happy birthday!

1174
01:29:02,875 --> 01:29:05,416
Not Yaya any more. Christian.

1175
01:29:05,625 --> 01:29:07,666
Oh, Marthe, my dear!

1176
01:29:09,291 --> 01:29:10,333
Daddy!

1177
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,041
My big girls!

1178
01:29:13,791 --> 01:29:15,125
You smell nice.

1179
01:29:15,791 --> 01:29:18,500
Marthe...
Let me introduce you to...

1180
01:29:19,333 --> 01:29:21,916
I'm so moved I forgot...

1181
01:29:22,083 --> 01:29:25,791
Let me introduce...
Let me introduce a friend of...

1182
01:29:25,958 --> 01:29:27,541
Hello, godmother!

1183
01:29:28,041 --> 01:29:30,250
You didn't tell me!

1184
01:29:30,916 --> 01:29:33,625
A surprise for Etienne.
We weren't expecting you.

1185
01:29:33,833 --> 01:29:35,083
Hi, kids!

1186
01:29:35,833 --> 01:29:38,583
Don't bother about me, I can't stay.

1187
01:29:38,833 --> 01:29:42,166
I wanted to thank godmother
for the sleeveless pullover.

1188
01:29:42,375 --> 01:29:45,541
- Etienne gave it to you?
- It was too big for me.

1189
01:29:45,791 --> 01:29:48,500
He means his shoulders
weren't square enough!

1190
01:29:48,791 --> 01:29:50,458
Did you say hello, Mimi?

1191
01:29:53,708 --> 01:29:56,791
She hasn't had a chance to yet.
Fetch some glasses...

1192
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,958
No, we really must go.

1193
01:29:59,125 --> 01:30:02,458
We're a bit upset.
Cost me a fortune, right, babe?

1194
01:30:02,708 --> 01:30:04,208
Tickets for Salle Pleyel.

1195
01:30:04,958 --> 01:30:06,541
But she loves all that.

1196
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,583
You can spare a minute...

1197
01:30:08,791 --> 01:30:12,041
No, no. Out of the question.
Anyway...

1198
01:30:12,291 --> 01:30:14,791
Best go or we'll miss the concert.

1199
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:17,333
Say goodbye, Mimi...

1200
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:22,750
Happy birthday, Etienne!

1201
01:30:45,375 --> 01:30:48,333
Do you like the gloves?
You can change them.

1202
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:52,458
Why would I change them?
They're sensational!

1203
01:30:52,666 --> 01:30:54,916
- Is Etienne with you?
- What's up?

1204
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:56,125
I need to see him.

1205
01:30:57,208 --> 01:31:00,458
Etienne, I don't know what to do.
I have to talk to you.

1206
01:31:00,666 --> 01:31:03,000
Excuse us, Marthe.
He's gone crazy.

1207
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:06,916
He wants to kill himself, kill her.
He just stuck one on me.

1208
01:31:07,083 --> 01:31:08,416
Who did? How?

1209
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:11,000
Bouly.
Marie-Ange has left him again.

1210
01:31:11,125 --> 01:31:14,250
She's left him! He's in the car...

1211
01:31:14,666 --> 01:31:17,916
Etienne's always been
like a big brother to him.

1212
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:21,416
And Bouly adores him,
so at a time like this...

1213
01:31:21,625 --> 01:31:23,625
- You were right to come.
- Look!

1214
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,708
Leave me alone! Get lost!

1215
01:31:25,875 --> 01:31:28,000
- Where are you going?
- To kill her!

1216
01:31:28,125 --> 01:31:30,958
Let go!
Get your stupid gloves off me!

1217
01:31:31,166 --> 01:31:33,666
Button it, Daniel! I'm warning you!

1218
01:31:34,083 --> 01:31:36,041
You don't know where she is!

1219
01:31:36,375 --> 01:31:39,250
Don't be a fool, Bouly!
This is serious.

1220
01:31:39,416 --> 01:31:40,833
I'll kill her!

1221
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:42,458
I'll kill her!

1222
01:31:42,875 --> 01:31:45,208
- Bouly!
- Bouly no longer exists!

1223
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:46,416
Etienne!

1224
01:31:47,291 --> 01:31:48,833
Shall I go back in?

1225
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,208
Go back inside.

1226
01:31:50,583 --> 01:31:51,541
Got the key?

1227
01:31:53,916 --> 01:31:55,000
Come on...

1228
01:31:59,125 --> 01:32:00,166
My kids!

1229
01:32:00,833 --> 01:32:01,875
But Why?

1230
01:32:02,666 --> 01:32:05,375
- I'm bleeding.
- You're not. Go on, get in.

1231
01:32:05,541 --> 01:32:08,041
Find me a bridge to jump off.

1232
01:32:08,166 --> 01:32:09,333
No! Look...

1233
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,666
He's crazy. I'm almost deaf.

1234
01:32:11,833 --> 01:32:13,750
You're fine. Get in.

1235
01:32:13,916 --> 01:32:15,791
- Listen to me...
- Shut up!

1236
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,083
Have you quite finished?

1237
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:20,166
Shut your face, asshole!

1238
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:22,791
He didn't mean it!

1239
01:32:47,916 --> 01:32:49,750
So it was an act!

1240
01:32:50,125 --> 01:32:52,333
That really takes the biscuit!

1241
01:32:53,791 --> 01:32:55,458
What a cheek!

1242
01:32:56,666 --> 01:33:00,208
We didn't know what to get you so...

1243
01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:04,875
I don't know her address.

1244
01:33:05,041 --> 01:33:07,541
Number 72, she said.
On the 8th floor.

1245
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:09,875
What did she say?

1246
01:33:10,208 --> 01:33:11,833
She'll tell you herself.

1247
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,625
That really hurt!

1248
01:33:13,833 --> 01:33:17,750
What about him? He punched me.
Good job I've got a six-pack!

1249
01:33:18,083 --> 01:33:19,458
I'm sorry.

1250
01:33:19,708 --> 01:33:22,916
- I'm pissed off 'cause I can't hear.
- You're bleeding.

1251
01:33:28,166 --> 01:33:29,458
Here it is.

1252
01:33:30,208 --> 01:33:32,500
Happy birthday, Etienne.

1253
01:33:32,708 --> 01:33:34,541
It gives me great pleasure...

1254
01:33:34,791 --> 01:33:36,458
Give the guy a break!

1255
01:33:45,833 --> 01:33:47,083
Etienne Dorsay.

1256
01:34:08,041 --> 01:34:10,416
Listen to me, Etienne Dorsay.

1257
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:16,458
A month ago I met an unmarried man
with no kids

1258
01:34:17,458 --> 01:34:19,833
who likes horses and traveling.

1259
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:23,541
In a month you've got married

1260
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:26,125
and had two 14-year-old daughters.

1261
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:30,125
We've traveled as far as
the top of the Arc de Triomphe.

1262
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:33,958
You don't get on horses,
rather horses get on top of you.

1263
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:38,250
In the country, your clothes
are ridiculed by children.

1264
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:42,375
And you fly to Belgium
while I'm waiting in London.

1265
01:34:44,083 --> 01:34:45,625
Stop gazing at your shoes

1266
01:34:45,833 --> 01:34:47,083
and look at me.

1267
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:51,208
After what happened earlier,
I want you

1268
01:34:51,916 --> 01:34:53,916
like I've never wanted anyone.

1269
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:57,416
Now why is that?

1270
01:34:58,083 --> 01:34:59,250
I don't know.

1271
01:34:59,916 --> 01:35:03,791
I want your hands.
I want to see your body unclothed.

1272
01:35:05,208 --> 01:35:08,708
You mean to say... naked.

1273
01:35:10,916 --> 01:35:12,000
Why?

1274
01:35:15,833 --> 01:35:19,000
Best not look for explanations.

1275
01:35:21,708 --> 01:35:24,958
I suggest you remove your bow tie.

1276
01:35:36,083 --> 01:35:39,916
Pitou? It's Marthe.
Are your parents there?

1277
01:35:40,166 --> 01:35:42,791
Mum and dad are out. I'm alone.

1278
01:35:44,875 --> 01:35:49,250
Only he isn't at Simon's.
Everybody seems to be out.

1279
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:52,375
No matter.
Know when they'll be back?

1280
01:35:53,083 --> 01:35:55,375
No. My dad broke a chair.

1281
01:35:56,416 --> 01:36:01,541
Had fate decreed that I should be
a man of national destiny,

1282
01:36:02,291 --> 01:36:06,916
the night I had just spent
would have gone down in history.

1283
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:10,416
Having fuelled my gluttony
with her silences,

1284
01:36:10,583 --> 01:36:12,375
Charlotte said in a second

1285
01:36:12,583 --> 01:36:15,166
what I had been unable to say
for a month.

1286
01:36:16,375 --> 01:36:17,625
"Come."

1287
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:23,041
A wonderful command
that put a spark into my life.

1288
01:36:25,375 --> 01:36:28,708
But such is the ugliness
of the male soul

1289
01:36:28,875 --> 01:36:31,708
that leaving Marthe
did not cross my mind,

1290
01:36:31,916 --> 01:36:36,750
not even for an alimony
amounting to 35.8% of my salary

1291
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,125
after deductions,

1292
01:36:39,375 --> 01:36:42,291
as it would have others
in my position...

1293
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,083
Simone?

1294
01:36:55,083 --> 01:36:56,125
Simone...

1295
01:37:04,083 --> 01:37:05,375
What is it?

1296
01:37:05,541 --> 01:37:08,208
Nothing. It's my husband.
He's downstairs.

1297
01:37:08,375 --> 01:37:09,666
Your husband!

1298
01:37:09,875 --> 01:37:10,916
Yes. Quick...

1299
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:13,791
What do you mean?
What husband?

1300
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,916
Come on, move. Hurry!

1301
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:17,916
The pillow!

1302
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,375
He's meant to be away all week.

1303
01:37:20,916 --> 01:37:22,416
It's only Friday.

1304
01:37:22,833 --> 01:37:24,791
Shall we demand an explanation?

1305
01:37:27,541 --> 01:37:29,208
Your watch...

1306
01:37:59,375 --> 01:38:01,125
What are you doing?

1307
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:03,416
Leave him to me.
I'll talk to him.

1308
01:38:03,625 --> 01:38:05,500
No! Leave him to me.

1309
01:38:05,708 --> 01:38:07,333
Come on, quick!

1310
01:38:08,375 --> 01:38:10,375
No, that's the window...

1311
01:38:10,541 --> 01:38:13,083
I know.
It's either that or the door.

1312
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:15,166
No, no. Don't worry.

1313
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:18,375
Just stand on the ledge.

1314
01:38:18,541 --> 01:38:21,166
I won't be long. He won't stay.

1315
01:38:22,125 --> 01:38:25,125
Go on, don't worry.
Wait for me there.

1316
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:28,375
Your clothes!

1317
01:38:28,541 --> 01:38:31,250
They're all folded up,
in the bathroom.

1318
01:38:32,458 --> 01:38:33,916
Coming!

1319
01:38:38,708 --> 01:38:40,333
I'd better go, Denis is at the door.

1320
01:38:44,166 --> 01:38:45,875
I was on the phone.

1321
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:47,625
To Jeannette.

1322
01:38:48,166 --> 01:38:49,375
Hello, darling!

1323
01:39:17,791 --> 01:39:19,041
Hey, look!

1324
01:39:32,083 --> 01:39:34,666
- What's the matter?
- That chap up there.

1325
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:48,166
No. He isn't here.

1326
01:40:04,458 --> 01:40:06,666
Is he going to jumP?

1327
01:40:11,125 --> 01:40:14,416
We land in Marrakech at...
ten past three.

1328
01:40:14,791 --> 01:40:17,291
But I have to work on Monday.

1329
01:40:17,458 --> 01:40:20,250
I'll put you on
the Sunday night plane.

1330
01:40:20,833 --> 01:40:23,083
- You're beautiful, you know.
- What?

1331
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:26,958
I said you're beautiful.
You heard me well enough.

1332
01:40:28,375 --> 01:40:30,083
Stop it, Denis !

1333
01:41:14,916 --> 01:41:17,791
We'd better call the fire brigade.

1334
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:21,833
There's a guy wants to jump
off a building...

1335
01:41:30,041 --> 01:41:31,625
Look, there he is!

1336
01:42:20,583 --> 01:42:22,750
Hey, are you coming?

1337
01:42:23,041 --> 01:42:25,083
I'm coming but I'll skip the game.

1338
01:42:25,208 --> 01:42:26,416
What now?

1339
01:42:26,666 --> 01:42:29,333
Thanks to your bullshit
she's left me for good.

1340
01:42:29,541 --> 01:42:30,708
Marie-Ange?

1341
01:42:30,875 --> 01:42:34,500
We got back so late
she thought I was with some bird.

1342
01:42:34,708 --> 01:42:36,166
- Shit!
- Damn!

1343
01:42:36,333 --> 01:42:39,500
- Did she take the furniture?
- No. What's up with you?

1344
01:42:39,708 --> 01:42:42,875
There was a ruptured spleen
so His Nibs here...

1345
01:42:43,041 --> 01:42:46,333
When Luberon got there, the guy
was dead so he went home,

1346
01:42:46,541 --> 01:42:48,083
found fat boy and...

1347
01:42:49,458 --> 01:42:53,000
But he was nice about it.
Took me to get the bullet out.

1348
01:42:53,958 --> 01:42:55,166
What a guy!

1349
01:42:55,375 --> 01:42:58,208
- Isn't Etienne with you?
- Why would he be?

1350
01:43:04,041 --> 01:43:06,583
Not the ladder! It scares them.

1351
01:43:06,791 --> 01:43:08,833
Nearly always makes them jump.

1352
01:43:09,041 --> 01:43:10,291
Come on!

1353
01:43:38,916 --> 01:43:41,375
Did she say she'd drop by?

1354
01:43:43,458 --> 01:43:47,166
If only to see the kids...

1355
01:43:50,375 --> 01:43:55,000
...at the junction of Rue de Tilsitt
and Avenue de la Grande Armee.

1356
01:43:55,875 --> 01:43:59,958
The building is right on the corner
of the two streets.

1357
01:44:00,208 --> 01:44:02,666
Fire Chief Commandant Claudon

1358
01:44:02,875 --> 01:44:05,375
is on the scene with his men

1359
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:08,750
who are trying to reach the ledge
from the roof...

1360
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:14,500
- Who touched the aerial?
- Not me!

1361
01:44:21,625 --> 01:44:23,375
That chap looks like dad!

1362
01:44:31,416 --> 01:44:32,666
Etienne...

1363
01:44:35,083 --> 01:44:36,958
Be sensible, sir!

1364
01:44:37,875 --> 01:44:39,708
Don't stay there!

1365
01:44:40,291 --> 01:44:43,000
Jump. Be a good lad.

1366
01:44:45,083 --> 01:44:48,833
Come on, jump.
Be a good lad, OK?

1367
01:45:29,791 --> 01:45:30,916
With Charlotte gone,

1368
01:45:32,166 --> 01:45:34,666
I was suddenly troubled
by the thought

1369
01:45:35,083 --> 01:45:36,666
that should Marthe leave me

1370
01:45:36,875 --> 01:45:40,208
it would not be without good reason.

1371
01:45:47,541 --> 01:45:49,291
Nevertheless I took steps

1372
01:45:49,541 --> 01:45:51,166
to ensure a soft landing.

1373
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,041
I counted, in my solitude,
a large number of women

1374
01:45:55,250 --> 01:45:57,500
in the welcoming committee below.

1375
01:45:59,166 --> 01:46:02,208
I couldn't help noticing
one of them

1376
01:46:02,416 --> 01:46:03,916
photographing me.

1377
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:06,541
One of those blondes one refers to

1378
01:46:07,083 --> 01:46:08,708
as "platinum".

1379
01:46:11,166 --> 01:46:15,208
In actual fact,
my ascent had barely begun...

1380
01:46:17,791 --> 01:46:20,416
