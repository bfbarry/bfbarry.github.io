            <p>This website is unfinished.  We are looking for members to help us with this endeavor!</p>
            
            <h2>A Brief Mission Statement</h2>
            <h3>Why are we doing this?</h3>
            <p>   &emsp; Deciding on a major and selecting what classes to take is a complex task, especially as an incoming college student.  
              Students in a major sometimes get tunnel vision and take college one quarter at a time, not realizing why they have 
              to take specific classes and how it ties into the big picture.  Prerequisites in certain majors can be very dependent 
              on one another, so being able to plan ahead by understanding how courses are related – through a visual “map” – is a 
              valuable asset. <br>
              &emsp; While existing campus resources are helpful, we wanted to offer a more intuitive set of tools to encourage a more 
              proactive and comprehensive planning of one’s college career.  As a student org we also believe students should be 
              more actively involved in understanding the structure of their majors.
            </p>

            <h3>What does our app want to accomplish?</h3>
            
            <p>   &emsp; We want this website to be an accessible tool students can use not just to plan classes for the next quarter, 
            but for their whole college career.  With the contribution of students and org members, we want to shed light 
            on the structure of majors, explaining why certain prerequisites are necessary. This can also be a hub to make 
            one’s first look at majors and individual classes more in depth than just scanning the course catalog – by adding 
            studying tips and resources to each class, so you know what to expect.<br>  
            &emsp; The main set of tools we are developing are applets to display a variety of road maps: one for majors, one for GEs, etc.  
            Thus far we have created the core framework, which is an applet displaying all dependent prerequisites for a given course. <br>
            &emsp; In the long term we’d like this to be an official tool used by the university – and possibly other universities.  By 
            collaborating with faculty, we hope to bridge the gap between the student body and administration. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>How do I join?</h2>
            <p>&emsp; We are looking for new principal members as well as members. We believe this is a great opportunity to 
              develop your leadership and/or coding skills, by working on a collaborative and creative project that can 
              help other students.</p>

            <h2>Current state of affairs (as of July 2020)</h2>
            <p>
              &emsp; So far we have created an applet on this website that generates a prerequisite map for a given course in the form of a <a href ='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph' target="_blank">directed acyclic graph</a>.</p>
